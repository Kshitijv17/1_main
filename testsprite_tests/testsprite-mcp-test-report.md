## TestSprite Test Report - 2024-07-29

**Summary:** All 8 TestSprite tests failed.

**Details:**
- The detailed test results are available in `testsprite_tests\tmp\report_prompt.json` within the project root.
- Due to the large size of `report_prompt.json`, I was unable to read its full content for a detailed breakdown.

**Next Steps:**
- Please present this report to the coding agent for further analysis and code fixes.
- If a more specific breakdown of failures is needed, please provide relevant sections or a summary of key failures from `report_prompt.json`.
